# Overview
This project is a personal project of mine that I'm still building out.  I'm creating a UI for the API game [Space Traders](https://spacetraders.io/).  I'm using Axios to send requests to a Node.js API that I built that is hosted on Heroku.  Data is stored in a MongoDb database.  The frontend is React with Redux and Redux-thunk.
